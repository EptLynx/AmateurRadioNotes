# Interference

A transmission that disturbs other operators is called **harmful interference**. Harmful interference is defined as *"endangering the use of a safety related system; or significantly degrading or repeatedly interrupting the use of radios or radio-sensitive equipment"*. You may **never** deliberately cause interference. If an amateur station is causing interference, Industry Canada may order them to stop.

Amateurs **may not** make trials or tests that have a possibility of causing interference.



# Qualifications

When operating your station, amateurs with more qualifications are only permitted to use **your operating privileges**. 

When operating another amateurs station with more qualifications, you are only permitted to use **your operating privileges**.

Qualifications take the lowest of the 2 (operator and station owner).

Frequencies below **30MHz** require one of the following:

- Morse Code Certification
- Advanced Qualifications
- Basic Qualification with Honours (>=80%)



# Spectrum, Bandwidth, and Usage

If a band has the amateur service as a "secondary user", that means amateurs are allowed to use the band **only** if they do not interfere with the "primary user".

All amateurs have an equal right to the allotted spectrum. ***Common sense and respect are expected from radio amateurs.***

Amateur is a secondary user of the following bands:

| Frequency     | Wavelength | Primary User    |
| ------------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| 430-450 MHz   | 70 CM      | Radiolocation   |
| 902-928 MHz   | 33 CM      | ISM, unlicensed |
| 1240-1300 MHz | 23 CM      |                 |
| 2300-2450 MHz | 15CM       |                 |

as well as some microwave frequencies.

You can not use non-amateur bands *except in immediate danger*. In situations of distress, an amateur station can use any band or power necessary, and if an amateur hears an unanswered distress signal on a band they don't have privileges for, they should offer assistance.

### Wavelength

Frequency in MHz = 300 / Wavelength in Meters

Wavelength in Meters = 300 / Frequency in MHz

### Allowed Bandwidth

| Frequency                       | Wavelength | Allowed Bandwidth |
| ------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| < 28 MHz                        |            | 6 kHz             |
| ^ **Exception:** 10.1-10.15 MHz | 30m        | 1 kHz             |
| 28.0-29.7 MHz                   | 10m        | 20 kHz            |
| 50-54 MHz                       | 6m         | 30 kHz            |
| 144-148 MHz                     | 2m         | 30 kHz            |
| 430-450 MHz                     | 70cm       | 12 MHz            |

### Bandwidth Requirements

| Communication | Bandwidth |
| ------------- | --------- |
| CW (Morse)    | 100 Hz    |
| RTTY          | 600 Hz    |
| SSB           | 2-3 kHz   |
| FM            | 10-20 kHz |
| Fast-scan TV  | 12 MHz    |

**FM is not allowed below 29.5 MHz**

When operating near the edge of a band, you must ensure the bandwidth needed to either side of the carrier frequency doesn't fall out-of-band.

# Communication

Amateurs can only communicate with **other licensed amateurs**.

Amateurs can make transmissions to assist relief operations **only if** normal communications are disrupted. During a disaster, most communications are handled by **nets** in predetermined frequencies. If you are not directly involved, avoid transmitting on or near those frequencies in an emergency situation. Messages from the **Red Cross** or **Civil Protection** can be handled at all times.

**No payment is allowed** for sending messages or operating amateur stations.

If a country has told the *International Telecommunications Union* (ITU) that they do not want amateur communications within their country, you are **forbidden from communicating** with a station in that country.



# Identification

Amateur stations must identify themselves at least **every 30 minutes**, and **at the beginning and end** of every contact. Only remote-control of model craft is exempt from this. You can identify in either **English** or **French**.

Canadian call signs begin with **VA, VE, VO,** or **VY.**



# Third-Party Communications

**Third-party communications:** "the transmission of *non-commercial* or *personal* messages to or on behalf of a third party."

If a non-amateur is using your station and a foreign station breaks in, you must determine if their country allows **third-party traffic**. Canada does not prohibit third-party traffic.

International third-party radiocommunication in disasters or emergencies is expressly permitted unless the foreign administration concerned has specifically prohibited it.

If you are allowing someone unlicensed to use your station, you must **continuously monitor and supervise** their participation.

Messages originating from **CFARS** (Canadian Forces Affiliate Radio Service) or MARS (United States Military Auxiliary Radio System) are not considered to be third-party.
