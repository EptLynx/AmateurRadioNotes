# Power Usage

You should always use *the minimum legal amount of power* needed to communicate.

Basic qualifications are limited to **250W DC input** or **560W PEP**. Advanced can use up to **1000W DC input**.

**P**eak **e**nvelope **p**ower is defined as "RF output power measured across an impedance matched load." You can check your output power at the antenna connector of the transmitter or amplifier.

**DC Input Power** is defined as "DC input power to the anode or collector circuit of the transmitter stage supplying RF energy to the antenna."

**Note:** watch out for where power is measured in questions. It is **not** at the receiver. PEP is measured at the antenna, DC input is measured at the transmitter.

# Repeaters

A **repeater** automatically retransmits other station's signals. They are used to extend the range of portables and mobiles.

You cannot retransmit to bands under **29.50 MHz** *unless the station being retransmitted is qualified to transmit below 29.50 MHz*.

# Frequency and Modulation

An **unmodulated carrier** can only be transmitted for *brief tests* under 30 MHz.

The frequency stability below **148 MHz** must be >= *crystal control*. **ALL** amateur stations must have a reliable means of determining their *operating frequency*.

If **radiotelephony** (voice) is used, you must have a reliable means to prevent or indicate *overmodulation*. The maximum permissible modulation is 100%.

# Regulations

In addition to the radiocommunications act, Canadian amateurs must follow regulations of the *International Telecommunications Union* (ITU). Canada is in ITU region 2. Australia and southeast Asia are in ITU region 3.

Canadian amateurs in the US must follow **US Regulations**. This includes within 22 km of the shores.

# Testing

The fee to take an examination at an *Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada* (ISED) office is $20 per qualification. Accredited examiners can negotiate a price with the candidates.

A disabled candidate must pass a test to receive a qualification, but accommodations *may be provided*.

Examinations must be taken in **English** or **French**.

# Antennas

Before installing an antenna that may raise community concern, owners **must consult their land-use authority** and address any community concerns. 

Consulting land use authorities is only exempted by applicable exclusions defined by ISED **or** by the land-use authority (both apply). Exclusions are listed in either **CPC-2-0-03** or the local land-use authority process.

If the local land-use authority does not have an existing public consultation process, amateurs must fulfill the requirements in ISED's **default public consultation process**, unless it is excluded by the land-use authority or ISED. This includes:

1. Providing an opportunity for the public to raise concerns
2. Addressing reasonable and relevant concerns provided in a **30 day public comment period** in writing
3. Providing written notice

The *Minister of Industry* has authority over all antenna installations. If the proponent of an antenna system and a stakeholder *other than the general public* reach an impasse, the final decision will be made by ISED.

# Safety Code 6

Health Canada publishes safety guidelines for the maximum amount of RF energy near the human body. **Safety Code 6** provides RF exposure limits for **al radio transmitters**, regardless of output power - it sets limits for induced current field strength. 

According to Safety Code 6, **30 to 300 MHz** pose the greatest risk, since the body most readily absorbs RF in this range.

Safety Code 6 does not specify power limits for VHF/UHF HT's, but this does not mean they are exempt from Safety Code 6's requirements.

# Interference

**Radio-sensitive equipment** is "any device, machinery, or equipment, other than radio apparatus, the use or functioning of which is, or can be, adversely affected by radiocommunications emissions."

If a neighbors equipment is malfunctioning, it is deemed the fault of the affected equipment's **lack of immunity** if the field strength on their property is below ISED's immunity criteria. If it is above the immunity criteria, it is the fault of the amateur's equipment.

Broadcast transmitters are not applicable in immunity complaints.
